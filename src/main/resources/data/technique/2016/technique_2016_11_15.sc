Trade Book:
The Design of Everyday Things, 2013 edition by Don Norman

Text Books:
Interaction Design by Jennifer Preece, Helen Sharp and Yvonne Rogers (in alphabetical order). There are four editions of this book. I believe any of the editions are a good purchase. This is the book I use in my undergraduate college course.
Human Computer Interaction, 2004 by Dix, Finlay, Abowd & Beale. This is an advance text book.
Understanding Your Users, 2015 edition by Baxter, Courage & Caine. I really like this book because it does what it claims, provides a "practical guide to User Research Methods."
